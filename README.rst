python-readability
==================

This module provides a reference implementation for consuming the
Readability API.


You can use it to:

- Add/Remove Bookmarks
- List Articles


Authentication options

- XAuth (API Keys + Username/Password)
- OAuth (API Keys + User Authorization)


Usage
-----


Authentication is simple::

    import readability

    token = readability.xauth('consumer-key', 'consumer-secret', 'username', 'password')
    rdd = readability.oauth('consumer-key', 'consumer-secret', token=token)


Get user info::

    >>> rdd.get_me()
    <user name="username">


List a user's bookmarks::

    >>> rdd.get_bookmarks()
    [<bookmark "1">, <bookmark "3">, <bookmark "5">, <bookmark "7">]

    >>> for b in rdd.get_bookmarks()
    ...     print b.article.url


List a user's favorites::

    >>> rdd.get_bookmarks(favorite=True)
    [<bookmark "3">]


Save the OAuth Token for later::

    >>> rdd.token_tuple
    ('oauth-token', 'oauth-secret')
