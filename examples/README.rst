Readability Examples
====================

Make sure to set your consumer key and consumer secret in settings.py
You need to have the following environment variables set:

- ``READABILITY_CONSUMER_KEY``
- ``READABILITY_CONSUMER_SECRET``

Example::

    export READABILITY_CONSUMER_KEY=test-account
    export READABILITY_CONSUMER_SECRET=BZ8WsJUrmLqRRqYr2h6dGWSUC5AP6Vhd


If you don't have a set of keys,
`request one <https://www.readability.com/contact>`_ from the Readability team.
